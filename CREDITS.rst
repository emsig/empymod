This project was started by **Dieter Werthmüller** at
`The Mexican Institute of Petroleum IMP <https://www.gob.mx/imp>`_
(Instituto Mexicano del Petróleo), funded (till 01/2017) by
`The Mexican National Council of Science and Technology
<https://conahcyt.mx>`_ (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología).
Dieter would like to thank his past and current employers who allowed and allow
him to maintain and further develop the code after the initial funding ended,
namely:

- 2017-2018: `The Mexican Institute of Petroleum IMP <https://www.gob.mx/imp>`_

- 2018-today: `Delft University of Technology <https://www.tudelft.nl>`_

  - 2018-2021:  Funded through *Gitaro.JIM*, a `MarTERA
    <https://www.martera.eu>`_ funded project within *Horizon 2020*
  - 2021-today: Funded through the `Delphi Consortium
    <https://www.delphi-consortium.com>`_

- 2021-today: `TERRASYS Geophysics GmbH & Co. KG <https://www.terrasysgeo.com>`_

Today it is a community effort, and many people helped to improve it over time.

There are various other ways than code how people have contributed. In the
following some particular credits.
