This project was started by **Dieter Werthmüller** at
`The Mexican Institute of Petroleum IMP <https://www.gob.mx/imp>`_
(Instituto Mexicano del Petróleo), funded (till 01/2017) by
`The Mexican National Council of Science and Technology
<https://www.conacyt.gob.mx>`_ (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología).
Today it is a community effort, and many people helped to improve it over time.

For a list of code contributors see

There are various other ways than code how people have contributed. In the
following some particular credits.
