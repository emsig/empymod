This project was started by **Dieter Werthmüller** at the IMP as part of a
CONAHCYT sponsored project (see below).
Dieter would like to thank his past and current employers who allowed and allow
him to maintain and further develop the code after the initial funding ended,
namely:

- 2016-2017: `The Mexican Institute of Petroleum IMP <https://www.gob.mx/imp>`_
  (Instituto Mexicano del Petróleo), funded through `The Mexican National
  Council of Science and Technology <https://conahcyt.mx>`_ (Consejo Nacional
  de Ciencia y Tecnología).
- 2017-2018: `The Mexican Institute of Petroleum IMP
  <https://www.gob.mx/imp>`_, funded through the electromagnetic group of
  Aleksander Mousatov.
- 2018-2021: `Delft University of Technology <https://www.tudelft.nl>`_;
  through the *Gitaro.JIM* project (till 05/2021, emg3d v1.0.0), funded by
  `MarTERA <https://www.martera.eu>`_ as part of Horizon 2020, a funding scheme
  of the European Research Area.
- 2021-2022: `TERRASYS Geophysics GmbH & Co. KG
  <https://www.terrasysgeo.com>`_.
- 2021-2024: `Delft University of Technology <https://www.tudelft.nl>`_ through
  the `Delphi Consortium <https://www.delphi-consortium.com>`_.
- 2024-today: `ETH Zurich <https://ethz.ch>`_ through the group `Geothermal
  Energy and Geofluids <https://geg.ethz.ch>`_.

Today it is a community effort, and many people helped to improve it over time.

There are various other ways than code how people have contributed. In the
following some particular credits.

Special thanks to

- **Jürg Hunziker**, **Kerry Key**, and **Evert Slob** for answering all my
  questions regarding their codes and publications
  (`Hunziker et al., 2015 <https://doi.org/10.1190/geo2013-0411.1>`_,
  `Key, 2009 <https://doi.org/10.1190/1.3058434>`_,

  `Slob et al., 2010 <https://doi.org/10.2528/PIER10052807>`_).

- **Evert Slob** for the feedback and interaction during the creation of the
  add-on ``tmtemod``, which was developed for the creation of
  `github.com/emsig/csem-ziolkowski-and-slob

- **The electromagnetic group** of Aleksander Mousatov at the Mexican Petroleum
  Institute, Mexico City (see note below).
