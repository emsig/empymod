    .. dropdown:: About the name and logo of **empymod**

        The name **empymod** is a portmanteau of *electromagnetic* (em),
        *python* (py), and *modelling* (mod): empymod is a an electromagnetic
        modeller in python.

        The name in the logo plays with the fact that *py* in python is
        pronounced the same as *pi*, the number. Pi is a fundamental constant
        in electromagnetic modelling.

        The symbol represents pi as well, with the three blue bars representing
        the integer part (3), and the red dot represents the fractional part
        (0.14159...).
