        .. dropdown:: About the name and logo of empymod

            The name **empymod** is a portmanteau of *electromagnetic* (em),
            *python* (py), and *modelling* (mod): empymod is a an electromagnetic
            modeller in python.

            The name in the logo plays with the fact that *py* in python is
            pronounced the same as *pi*, the number. Pi is a fundamental constant
            in electromagnetic modelling.

            The symbol represents pi as well, with the three blue bars representing
            the integer part (3), and the red dot represents the fractional part
            (0.14159...).
