Theory
------

The code is principally based on

- [HuTS15]_ for the wavenumber-domain calculation (``kernel``),
- [Key12]_ for the DLF and QWE transforms,
- [SlHM10]_ for the analytical half-space solutions, and
- [Hami00]_ for the FFTLog.

See these publications and all the others given in the :doc:`references`, if
you are interested in the theory on which empymod is based. Another good
reference is [ZiSl19]_. The book derives in great detail the equations for
layered-Earth CSEM modelling.


Installation
------------

You can install empymod either via ``conda``:

.. code-block:: console

   conda install -c prisae empymod

or via ``pip``:

.. code-block:: console

   pip install empymod

Required are Python version 3.5 or higher and the modules ``NumPy`` and
``SciPy``. The module ``numexpr`` is required additionally (built with Intel's
VML) if you want to run parts of the kernel in parallel.

The modeller empymod comes with add-ons (``empymod.scripts``). These add-ons
provide some very specific, additional functionalities. Some of these add-ons
have additional, optional dependencies for other modules such as
``matplotlib``. See the *Add-ons*-section for their documentation.

If you are new to Python I recommend using a Python distribution, which will
ensure that all dependencies are met, specifically properly compiled versions
of ``NumPy`` and ``SciPy``; I recommend using `Anaconda
<https://www.anaconda.com/distribution>`_. If you install Anaconda you can
simply start the *Anaconda Navigator*, add the channel ``prisae`` and
``empymod`` will appear in the package list and can be installed with a click.


The structure of empymod is:

- **model.py**: EM modelling routines.
- **utils.py**: Utilities for ``model`` such as checking input parameters.
- **kernel.py**: Kernel of ``empymod``, calculates the wavenumber-domain
  electromagnetic response. Plus analytical, frequency-domain full- and
  half-space solutions.
- **transform.py**: Methods to carry out the required Hankel transform from
  wavenumber to space domain and Fourier transform from frequency to time
  domain.
- **filters.py**: Filters for the *Digital Linear Filters* method DLF (Hankel
  and Fourier transforms).


Usage/Examples
--------------

A good starting point is [Wert17b]_, and more information can be found in
[Wert17]_. There are a lot of examples of its usage available, in the form of
Jupyter notebooks. Have a look at the following repositories:

- Example notebooks: https://github.com/empymod/empymod-examples,
- Geophysical Tutoriol TLE: https://github.com/empymod/article-tle2017, and
- Numerical examples of [ZiSl19]_:
  https://github.com/empymod/csem-ziolkowski-and-slob.

The main modelling routines is ``bipole``, which can calculate the
electromagnetic frequency- or time-domain field due to arbitrary finite
electric or magnetic bipole sources, measured by arbitrary finite electric or
magnetic bipole receivers. The model is defined by horizontal resistivity and
anisotropy, horizontal and vertical electric permittivities and horizontal and
vertical magnetic permeabilities. By default, the electromagnetic response is
normalized to source and receiver of 1 m length, and source strength of 1 A.

A simple frequency-domain example, with most of the parameters left at the
default value:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from empymod import bipole
    >>> # x-directed bipole source: x0, x1, y0, y1, z0, z1
    >>> src = [-50, 50, 0, 0, 100, 100]
    >>> # x-directed dipole source-array: x, y, z, azimuth, dip
    >>> rec = [np.arange(1, 11)*500, np.zeros(10), 200, 0, 0]
    >>> # layer boundaries
    >>> depth = [0, 300, 1000, 1050]
    >>> # layer resistivities
    >>> res = [1e20, .3, 1, 50, 1]
    >>> # Frequency
    >>> freq = 1
    >>> # Calculate electric field due to an electric source at 1 Hz.
    >>> # [msrc = mrec = True (default)]
    >>> EMfield = bipole(src, rec, depth, res, freq, verb=4)

Hook for user-defined calculation of :math:`\eta` and :math:`\zeta`
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In principal it is always best to write your own modelling routine if you want
to adjust something. Just copy ``empymod.dipole`` or ``empymod.bipole`` as a
template, and modify it to your needs. Since ``empymod v1.7.4``, however, there
is a hook which allows you to modify :math:`\eta_h, \eta_v, \zeta_h`, and
:math:`\zeta_v` quite easily.

The trick is to provide a dictionary (we name it ``inp`` here) instead of the
resistivity vector in ``res``. This dictionary, ``inp``, has two mandatory plus
optional entries:

- ``res``: the resistivity vector you would have provided normally (mandatory).
- A function name, which has to be either or both of (mandatory)

    - ``func_eta``: To adjust ``etaH`` and ``etaV``, or
    - ``func_zeta``: to adjust ``zetaH`` and ``zetaV``.

- In addition, you have to provide all parameters you use in
  ``func_eta``/``func_zeta`` and are not already provided to ``empymod``. All
  additional parameters must have #layers elements.

The functions ``func_eta`` and ``func_zeta`` must have the following
characteristics:

- The signature is ``func(inp, p_dict)``, where

    - ``inp`` is the dictionary you provide, and
    - ``p_dict`` is a dictionary that contains all parameters so far calculated
      in empymod [``locals()``].

- It must return ``etaH, etaV`` if ``func_eta``, or ``zetaH, zetaV`` if
  ``func_zeta``.

**Dummy example**

.. code-block:: python

    def my_new_eta(inp, p_dict):
        # Your calculations, using the parameters you provided
        # in `inp` and the parameters from empymod in `p_dict`.
        # In the example line below, we provide, e.g.,  inp['tau']
        return etaH, etaV

And then you call ``empymod`` with ``res={'res': res-array, 'tau': tau,
'func_eta': my_new_eta}``.

Have a look at the example ``2d_Cole-Cole-IP`` in the `empymod-examples
<https://github.com/empymod/empymod-examples>`_ repository, where this hook is
exploited in the low-frequency range to use the Cole-Cole model for IP
calculation. It could also be used in the high-frequency range to model
dielectricity.


Contributing
------------

New contributions, bug reports, or any kind of feedback is always welcomed!
Have a look at the Roadmap-section to get an idea of things that could be
implemented. The best way for interaction is at https://github.com/empymod.
If you prefer to contact me outside of GitHub use the contact form on my
personal website, https://werthmuller.org.

To install empymod from source, you can download the latest version from GitHub
and install it in your python distribution via:

.. code-block:: console

   python setup.py install

Please make sure your code follows the pep8-guidelines by using, for instance,
the python module ``flake8``, and also that your code is covered with
appropriate tests. Just get in touch if you have any doubts.


Tests and benchmarks
--------------------

The modeller comes with a test suite using ``pytest``. If you want to run the
tests, just install ``pytest`` and run it within the ``empymod``-top-directory.

.. code-block:: console

    > pip install pytest coveralls pytest-flake8 pytest-mpl
    > # and then
    > cd to/the/empymod/folder  # Ensure you are in the right directory,
    > ls -d */                  # your output should look the same.
    docs/  empymod/  tests/
    > # pytest will find the tests, which are located in the tests-folder.
    > # simply run
    > pytest --cov=empymod --flake8 --mpl

It should run all tests successfully. Please let me know if not!

Note that installations of ``empymod`` via conda or pip do not have the
test-suite included. To run the test-suite you must download ``empymod`` from
GitHub.

There is also a benchmark suite using *airspeed velocity*, located in the
`empymod/empymod-asv <https://github.com/empymod/empymod-asv>`_-repository. The
results of my machine can be found in the `empymod/empymod-bench
<https://github.com/empymod/empymod-bench>`_, its rendered version at
`empymod.github.io/empymod-asv <https://empymod.github.io/empymod-asv>`_.
