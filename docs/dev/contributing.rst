Contributing
============

empymod is a community code, and contributions of any kind are welcomed: From
typos in the documentation to additional examples, reporting or fixing bugs in
the code, all the way to new suggestion or implementing new features.

Good places to get started is to browse the existing issues, check out the
roadmap, or have a look at any open PR:

- `Issues <https://github.com/emsig/empymod/issues>`_;
- `Roadmap <https://github.com/emsig/empymod/issues/223>`_;
- `PR's <https://github.com/emsig/empymod/pulls>`_.

There are various different ways to get in touch, see
`emsig.xyz#contributing-contact <https://emsig.xyz/#contributing-contact>`_.

If you think about making changes to the code and contribute code have a look
at :doc:`tests`


.. note::

    The community is tiny so far, so there are no former protocols (such as
    CoC) in place (yet). Please get in touch if you think it is about time to
    implement those.
