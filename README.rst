The electromagnetic modeller **empymod** can model electric or magnetic
responses due to a three-dimensional electric or magnetic source in a
layered-earth model with vertical transverse isotropic (VTI) resistivity, VTI
electric permittivity, and VTI magnetic permeability, from very low frequencies
(DC) to very high frequencies (GPR). The calculation is carried out in the
wavenumber-frequency domain, and various Hankel- and Fourier-transform methods
are included to transform the responses into the space-frequency and space-time
domains.

See https://empymod.github.io/#features for a complete list of features.
