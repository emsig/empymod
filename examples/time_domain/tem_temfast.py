TEM: AEMR TEM-FAST 48 system
============================

**In this example we compute the TEM response from the TEM-FAST 48 system.**

This example was contributed by Lukas Aigner (`@aignerlukas
<https://github.com/aignerlukas>`_), who was interested
in modelling the TEM-FAST system, which is used at the TU Wien.
If you are interested and want to use this work please have a look at the
corresponding paper Aigner et al. (2024).

The modeller ``empymod`` models the electromagnetic (EM) full wavefield Greens
function for electric and magnetic point sources and receivers. As such, it can
model any EM method from DC to GPR. However, how to actually implement a
particular EM method and survey layout can be tricky, as there are many more
things involved than just computing the EM Greens function.

What is not included in ``empymod`` at this moment (but hopefully in the
future), but is required to model TEM data, is to **account for arbitrary
source waveform**, and to apply a **lowpass filter**. So we generate these two
things here, and create our own wrapper to model TEM data. See also the example
:ref:`sphx_glr_gallery_tdomain_tem_walktem.py`, on which this example
builds upon.

def get_time(time, r_time):
    """Additional time for ramp.

    Because of the arbitrary waveform, we need to compute some times before and
    after the actually wanted times for interpolation of the waveform.

    Some implementation details: The actual times here don't really matter. We
    create a vector of time.size+2, so it is similar to the input times and
    accounts that it will require a bit earlier and a bit later times. Really
    important are only the minimum and maximum times. The Fourier DLF, with
    `pts_per_dec=-1`, computes times from minimum to at least the maximum,
    where the actual spacing is defined by the filter spacing. It subsequently
    interpolates to the wanted times. Afterwards, we interpolate those again to
    compute the actual waveform response.

    Note: We could first call `waveform`, and get the actually required times
          from there. This would make this function obsolete. It would also
          avoid the double interpolation, first in `empymod.model.time` for the
          Fourier DLF with `pts_per_dec=-1`, and second in `waveform`. Doable.
          Probably not or marginally faster. And the code would become much
          less readable.

    """Custom wrapper of empymod.model.bipole.

    Here, we compute TEM-FAST data using the ``empymod.model.bipole`` routine
    as an example. This function is based upon the Walk TEM example.

    We model the big source square loop by computing only half of one side of
    the electric square loop and approximating the finite length dipole with 3
    point dipole sources. The result is then multiplied by 8, to account for
    all eight half-sides of the square loop.

    The implementation here assumes a central loop configuration, where the
    receiver (1 m2 area) is at the origin, and the source is a
    square_side x square_side m electric loop, centered around the origin.

    Note: This approximation of only using half of one of the four sides
          obviously only works for central, horizontal square loops. If your
          loop is arbitrary rotated, then you have to model all four sides of
          the loop and sum it up.

    ----------
    off_time : ndarray
