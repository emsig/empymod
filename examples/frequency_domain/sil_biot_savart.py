Comparison to Biot-Savart
=========================

Even though empymod was developed having CSEM in mind, the various inputs make
it possible to investigate other acquisition setups such as, for instance, line
sources. The simplest way to investigate the magnetic field of line sources is
by using the Biot-Savart law for an infinite wire, given by

.. math::
    :label: biot-savart

    B(r,I) = \frac{\mu_{0} I}{2\pi r} \, ,

where :math:`I` is the source strength, :math:`\mu_0` is the magnetic
permeability of free space, and :math:`r` is distance.

Let us consider a line source approximated as a very long, but finite bipole
with lots of source points, and compare it to the Biot-Savart solution.

.. note::

    This example was contributed by Sil Mossel (`@SylvesterOester
    <https://github.com/SylvesterOester>`_). You can find out more about his
    work in his M.Sc. thesis available (from late '22 onwards) at the `TU Delft
    Repository <https://repository.tudelft.nl>`_.

# Define survey and models

# We set the line in the xy-plane at zero depth. The line runs from 0 to 90

# should be extended with more source points for it to approximate an infinite
# wire.

# - (0, 0) = x-dir;
# - ('theta', -90) = z-dir;

# (any ('theta', -90) is Z as the azimuth does not matter if dip is exactly
# +/-90; minus sign due to RHS system).

# Plots
# -----
#
# Plotting the Biot-Savart and empymod fullspace and halfspace solutions. What
# is noticeable is that the Biot-Savart and fullspace solution, as well as the
# Bz-field component from all three solutions, are close to identical. The
# biggest change is related to the By-component in the halfspace solution. This
# is related to the relative TE and TM modes. The Bz-field is determined by the
# TE mode and the By-field to TM. Recalling the reflection coefficients:
#
# .. math::
#     :label: rtm
#
#     r_n^{TM} =
#     \frac{\eta_{n+1} \Gamma_{n}-\eta_{n} \Gamma_{n+1}}
#     {\eta_{n+1}\Gamma_{n}+\eta_{n} \Gamma_{n+1}}\, ,
#
# .. math::
#     :label: rte
#
#     r_n^{TE} =
#     \frac{\zeta_{n+1} \Gamma_{n}-\zeta_{n} \Gamma_{n+1}}
#     {\zeta_{n+1} \Gamma_{n}+\zeta_{n} \Gamma_{n+1}}\, .
#
# Since the conductivity of air almost zero, in a half-space the local
# reflection coefficient :math:`r^{TM} = 1`. At the same time, :math:`r^{TE}`
# is dominated by :math:`\mu_0` which is similar in air as in any soil, making
# the reflection coefficient for the TE mode equal to zero.

# Plot total fields.

# If we take a finite length wire, eventually Biot-Savart for an infinite
# length wire will not apply. The question is: at what receiver distance
# relative to the finite wire is Biot-Savart still decently applicable. When
# testing this in empymod and comparing Biot-Savart for an infinite line source
# to a finite length wire, it is has been concluded that when the receiver is a
# 1/10th of the length of the wire away from its middle, Biot-Savart and
# empymod agree within 2%. For 1% accuracy between the two methods, the
# receiver distance should not extend more than 7% of the length of the wire.
